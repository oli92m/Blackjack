# Blackjack
Program about strategy and card counting in Blackjack.

The program will give two types of information: 
- the strategy for the round (pick a card, stay...)
- the cards count (including the Aces for the most advanced players).

The betting amount is not precized since it depends of each player's money, risk tolerance...

This code was one of my first "medium size" project so the code structure could certainly be improved. 
(e.g. the big while loop could be split in the different functions and a new main function where we have a while loop).
